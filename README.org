** Installation and Configuration
Using straight.el and use-package.el (see [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#integration-with-use-package]])

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package graphql-doc
  :straight '(graphql-doc
              :type git
              :host github
              :repo "ifitzpatrick/graphql-doc.el")
  :config
  (graphql-doc-add-api
   "GDC (national cancer institute)" ; Name that will be displayed in completing-read when you start graphql-doc
   `(:url "https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/v0/graphql" ; url for graphql endpoint
          :data nil ; alist of additional post body data items
          :headers nil ; alist of additional headers
          )))
#+end_src
** Usage
*** Opening the GraphQL Doc Explorer
There are two commands provided to open up the graphql-doc explorer
- *graphql-doc* prompts you to select an endpoint added by *graphql-doc-add-api*

  Use this for graphql endpoints that you use often, or need additional
  configuration such as authorization headers.
- *graphql-doc-open-url* prompts you to provide a graphql endpoint url

  Use this to quickly view the documentation for endpoints that don't need
  additional configuration.
*** Configuring endpoints
This package provides the function *graphql-doc-add-api* to add endpoints to the alist *graphql-doc-apis*.
These endpoints are then selectable by name by calling *graphql-doc*.

**** Simple
If the endpoint does not require autorization, you only need to provide a name, and an api configuration with a url.
#+begin_src elisp
(graphql-doc-add-api
 "GDC (national cancer institute)"
 `(:url "https://api.gdc.cancer.gov/v0/graphql"))
#+end_src
**** Authorization header
If the endpoint does requires an autorization header (or any other additional headers),
you can provide that with the `headers` property in your api configuration.
#+begin_src elisp
(graphql-doc-add-api
 "My cool graphql endpoint"
 `(:url "https://awesome-endpoints.com/v0/graphql"
   :headers (("authorization" . "bearer my-secret-api-token")
             ("Exta-Header" . "another example header"))))
#+end_src
**** Additional post body parameters
Some endpoints may expect additional post body parameters, which you can provide
with the `data` property in your api configuration.
#+begin_src elisp
(graphql-doc-add-api
 "My cool graphql endpoint"
 `(:url "https://awesome-endpoints.com/v0/graphql"
   :data (("additional-data" . "example data")
          ("authorization" . "this endpoint expects authorization in the post body!"))))
#+end_src
